    <p>Do we really need a recipe for fruit salad? In this case—yes. Here, our simple honey citrus dressing takes strawberries, raspberries, and blueberries up a notch, 
        elevating this classic summer salad to new heights. Read on for tips on how to make this side dish shine. And if you’re looking for more sides to round out your 
        barbecue, check out more of our favorite summer sides. </p>

    <h3>Can I use other fruit? </h3>

    <p>Absolutely. Honestly, you could use whatever fresh fruit you want in this salad: blackberries, bananas, cherries, pineapple . . . the sky’s the limit. </p>

    <p>Can I use frozen fruit? We like to play the cool parent here at Delish and we never want to say no . . . but in this case, no. Fruit is mostly water, and 
        when it freezes, all that water expands, effectively bursting the fruit’s cell walls. Why does that matter? Well, when you defrost it, the fruit’s structure
        completely collapses, and the fruit ends up deflated and mushy . . . not exactly great for fruit salad. If you have frozen fruit you’re dying to use up, try
        making a smoothie instead.</p>  

    <p>I don’t eat honey. Can I sub in another liquid sweetener? </p>

    <p>You sure can. We’d recommend agave, since its neutral sweetness will really let the fruit’s flavor shine. Maple syrup is another possibility, but keep in mind 
        that it will bring along its own maple flavor which might detract from those summery fruit salad vibes. </p>

    <h3>Can I make this ahead of time? </h3>

    <p>Just hold off on the dressing and keep your cut fruit well-covered and refrigerated until it’s time to serve. We recommend prepping the fruit no more than 4 
        hours in advance—any longer and you’ll start to see the cut fruit shrivel and oxidize (not exactly our idea of delicious.) If you’re concerned about your 
        chopped apples browning too much, try tossing them with a tablespoon of lemon juice and layering them under the rest of the fruit at the bottom of the bowl. </p>
